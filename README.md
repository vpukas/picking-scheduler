## General Information
The goal is to create an application that prepares a schedule of picking
orders for employees of the so-called "dark store". Employees walk around the store and collect items that customers have ordered
online. The completed orders are then placed in locked cabinets, from which
from which customers can pick them up themselves. We aim to complete as many of them as possible. Each
"picker" should be assigned a list of orders to be completed on a business day. Orders,
that cannot be completed on time are left out of the result.
